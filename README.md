# appfiller
appfiller.py is a program written in Python3 (3.9) that uses the Selenium WebDriver in conjunction with Google Chrome to autofill internship applications for any company hosting their application on jobs.lever.co for now. Currently, I am working on improving the run-time (7-8 seconds for full completion) and working around unique identifiers for certain applications. Additionally, I am working on application fillers for other websites, such as Workday.
