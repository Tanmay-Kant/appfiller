# appfiller
appfiller.py is a program written in Python3 (3.9) that uses the Selenium WebDriver in conjunction with Google Chrome to autofill internship applications for any company on jobs.lever.co
currently, I am working on improving the run-time (7-8 seconds for full completion) and working around unique identifiers for certain applications.
additionally, I am working on application fillers for other websites, such as Workday.
